# Lethal Company Quota Calculator
## Purpose
This calculator takes your scrap totals from the game Lethal Company and calculates the least amount of money required to give to the Company for maximum profit.
## Requirements
The calculator requires that Python be installed.
## Usage
Once the calculator is launched, you can put in the prices of all your scrap and then put in the quota amount. The calculator will then automatically calculate the prices of the scrap you need to sell.
### Windows
To run the program on Windows, simply run the executable file in the `quotaCalc Windows` folder.
### macOS
On macOS, double-click on the terminal executable file to run it. This is located in the `quotaCalc macOS` folder.
### Linux
Enter the `quotaCalc Linux` folder and then manually launch the terminal. In the terminal, make sure you are in the calculator's current directory by using the command `cd` to change directory. To ensure you're in the correct directory, you can type `pwd` which should result in the following output: `/path/to/directory/quotaCalc Linux`. Now, type `./quotaCalc` in the terminal and the calculator should launch!
